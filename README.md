# Project Name: DynaMine

## Project Description
DynaMine is a web browser game designed for entertainment. The game has intuitive controls and a simple concept. The user moves the "player" with WASD to collect rocks. There are moving objects for the player to either dodge or try to grab. The game stores the top five scores that are saved to the local browser storage. This is a way to keep usernames and scores private while also allowing the creation of different user names if scores are saved by multiple users of the same browser.

## Project Tasks
- **Task 1: Set up the development environment**
  - Install necessary software and tools (Node.js, npm, Phaser, webpack)
  - Configure Git and GitHub repository
- **Task 2: Design the application**
  - Draw wireframes and brainstorm themes
  - Plan the interface for the 3 screens and how they communicate
- **Task 3: Develop the front end**
  - Design the UI from the wireframes and use Phaser, javascript, and html to do so
  - Implement the game score display and visual assetts
- **Task 4: Develop the backend**
  - Setup the server with Node.js, Webpack 4, and WebDev
  - Implement the score and username saving within local storage
- **Task 5: Set up the local storage**
  - Set up an empty array in local storage to keep the five highest scores
  - Allow the array to accept and keep new highscores if they are higher
- **Task 6: Test the application**
  - Play the game testing scoring and game over mechanics
  - Test score and user name saving
  - Debug and fix issues
- **Task 7: Document the project**
  - Create a comprehensive README file
