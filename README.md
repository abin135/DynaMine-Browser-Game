# Project Name: DynaMine

## Project Description
DynaMine is a web browser game designed for entertainment. The game has intuitive controls and a simple concept. The user moves the "player" with WASD to collect rocks. There are moving objects for the player to either dodge or try to grab. The game stores the top five scores that are saved to the local browser storage. This is a way to keep usernames and scores private while also allowing the creation of different user names if scores are saved by multiple users of the same browser.
